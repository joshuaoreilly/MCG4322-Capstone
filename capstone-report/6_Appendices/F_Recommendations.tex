\section{Recommendations for Improving the Course}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the course over two semesters.
    \item Give projects of smaller scope so that students can perfect it more and build the design. This could also reduce stress levels by making the project less initially intimidating.
    \item Make students build the project.
    \item The grading value of the Analysis Report should match more closely the ratio of time allocated for that deliverable compared to others.
\end{enumerate}
