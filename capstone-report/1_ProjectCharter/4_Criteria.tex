\subsection{Criteria}

Power consumption per kilogram (device and litter) should be minimized.
The operating time should be maximized for better litter collection efficiency.
The robot's capacity to navigate a variety of environments, including sand and pebble beaches, shallow water, mud and around small plants, should be maximized.
The mechanical stability of the robot should be optimized as well to allow navigation of rough terrain.
Finally, aesthetics should be considered as it will operate in public spaces.
