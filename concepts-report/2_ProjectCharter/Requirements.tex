\subsection{Requirements}

The design is to be solar powered, with a locomotion system inspired by biomimetic morphologies. The device must be able to operate in waterfront environments and difficult terrain such as sand, mud, rock, plants and bramble. It must be completely sealed to the elements such as rain, water, humidity, wind, sand, dust and high heat. It is also to be self-reliant and only require human intervention to empty the waste holding tank. This includes the consideration for potential vandalism. The design created by this group (2A) must interface with the litter collector of a size of 1 to 5000 cm$^3$ and litter capacity from 1 to 5 kg, which is designed by another group (2B).
