\subsection{Criteria}

The following criteria were selected as guides to optimize the design. First, the power consumption per kilogram (device and litter) is to be minimized. Additionally, the operating time of the device is to be maximized for more waste collecting efficiency. 
More specifically to the above required operating terrains, the ability to operate on sandy and pebble beaches as well as shallow water, mud and small plants (foot design, mechanical stability) should be optimized. The range of mobility of the device, such as turning and operating on slopes, is also to be optimized.
Lastly, as the device will operate in public areas, the aesthetic appeal is to be considered.
