\section{Decision Analysis Tables} \label{app:decision_analysis_tables}

Decision analysis' are shown in the following tables. Concepts are scored (S) from 1 (worst) to 3 (best). This is then multiplied by the weight to get the weighed score (WS) and a total sum is calculated for each solution. The concept with the highest total is the winner.

Table \ref{table:decision_analysis_robot} shows the decision analysis for the robot locomotion concepts. 
The highest weight of 30/100 is attributed to power consumption, as the solution must be solar powered, making power a limiting factor. The scores are attributed based on the number of electric motors on each solution. 

The next criteria, weighed at 20/100, is mobility and terrain operation. This includes ability to turn, navigate on slopes and walk in various difficult terrains such as sand, pebbles, shallow water, mud and small plants. 

The next criteria weighs 20/100 as well and consists of feasibility and design complexity. This relates to the the simplicity of the design as well as the complexities that may arise in further analysis of the design (force concentrations on parts, number of components to consider, etc). 

Furthermore, maintainability and longevity is added with a weight of 15/100. This is included due to the fact that the robot should be self-reliant. It takes into account frequency and ease of maintenance.

The last two criteria are: aesthetics (10/100) as the robot operates in public areas, and cost (5/100) which is a minor consideration due to the fact that this solution has very little existing competition. It is still considered in order to ensure the designs' feasibility.

Table \ref{table:decision_analysis_solar} shows the decision analysis for the solar panel solutions. 

The most critical criteria, weighed at 35/100 is to maximise the sun exposure surface. This includes maximising the surface area of the solar panels as well as orienting them in a favourable manner towards the sun. It determines the amount of power output from the solar panels. 

The second highest weighed criteria, with 30/100, is compatibility and integration. This includes whether the solar panels could impede with the movement of the robots' legs or other moving parts. It also takes into account whether it could potentially interfere with the integration of the waste collecting system designed by group 2B. It was discussed that a garbage container might be positioned on top of the robot, with an arm moving to deposit waste in the container.

Stability, weighed at 20/100, takes into account the effects of the solar panels on the center of mass of he robot and whether they could get caught in the wind. Lastly, cost is included as a measure of complexity of the solutions, and weighs 15/100.

\subsection{Battery Selection}

Batteries were selected in the following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Power consumption per motor was set at 50W; not all motors will be running at the same time, nor at full capacity, so 50\% of total capacity was selected.
    \item Power consumption for computers is set conservatively to the full power of NVIDIA Jetson TX2s; these consume more power than Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, giving a conservative approximation \cite{gadget_makers_blog_arduino_2013} \cite{raspi.tv_how_2019} \cite{nvidia_jetson_2018}.
    \item The battery voltage matches the highest voltage element in the robot. This is likely the motors, which in the given configuration need 24 V, compared to up to 15 V for the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 \cite{nvidia_jetson_2018} \cite{maxon_motor_ec60_nodate}.
    \item A runtime of two hours was selected. This is in line with the two to four hours advertised by ANYbotics' ANYmal and hour-and-a-half advertised by Boston Dynamics' Spot \cite{anybotics_anymal_nodate} \cite{boston_dynamics_spot_2019}.
    \item The  Panasonic NCR18650B variant of 18650 cell were selected (same model as used in Tesla batteries), with 3.6 V and 3400mAh (12.58 Wh) \cite{18650_battery_store_18650_nodate} \cite{lambert_tear_2016}.
    \item The number of cells required is equal to the number of cells required to achieve the desired voltage, times the number of cells required to achieve the two hour runtime. In the case of the crab model, it requires seven cells in series and 42 is parallel, or approximately 300 cells in total.
