\subsection{Cost Assessment}

A detailed cost assessment was conducted on all concepts and is shown in Appendix \ref{app:cost_assessment}. The summary of overall prices for each concept is shown in Table \ref{table:concept_cost_summary} for robot concepts and Table \ref{table:solar_concept_cost_summary} for solar concepts. The robot concept 2 is the most expensive. This may be due to the fact that more pricey components were used, such as carbon fiber legs and harmonic drives. It would be determined with further analysis whether these pricier options are necessary, or if cheaper elements can be used, for example planetary gears and metal or plastic legs. Although the cost assessment result is higher for concept 2 compared to concept 3, it was determined that overall the concept 2 would be less expensive if similar graded components and parts as concept 3 were used.
For the solar concepts, concept 3 is cheaper as it does not require additional material for a frame. Solar concept 1 is more expensive as it has a more complex frame as well as more solar panel surface area, and thus costs more in solar panels (albeit with higher power collection).
