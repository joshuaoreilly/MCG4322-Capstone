\subsection{Criteria}

Power consumption per kilogram (device and litter) should be minimized.
The operating time should be maximized for better litter collection efficiency.
The robot's capacity to navigate a variety of environments, including sand and pebble beaches, shallow water, mud and around small plants, should be maximized.
The mechanical stability of the robot should be optimized as well to allow navigation of rough terrain.
Finally, aesthetics should be considered as it will operate in public spaces.

The following criteria were selected as guides to optimize the design. First, the power consumption per kilogram (device and litter) is to be minimized. Additionally, the operating time of the device is to be maximized for more waste collecting efficiency. 
More specifically to the above required operating terrains, the ability to operate on sandy and pebble beaches as well as shallow water, mud and small plants (foot design, mechanical stability) should be optimized. The range of mobility of the device, such as turning and operating on slopes, is also to be optimized.
Lastly, as the device will operate in public areas, the aesthetic appeal is to be considered.
