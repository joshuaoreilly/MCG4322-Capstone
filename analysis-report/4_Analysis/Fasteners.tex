%------------------- BOLT ANALYSIS -------------------%
\subsection{Fasteners} \label{subsec:bolt_analysis}


%------------------------------ Inputs and Outputs ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Inputs and Outputs}

Inputs include the number of bolts $n$, distance $P$ from the applied forces to the centroid, distance from the bolt to centroid $r$, and angles $\rho$ and $\epsilon$ between $P$ and $x$ around $z$ and $y$ respectively (variables shown in Figure \ref{fig:bolt_fbd_hip}).
The minimum acceptable bolt diameter $d$, member thickness $t$ and distance from bolt to member edge $\ell$ are then calculated.


%------------------------------ CONSTANTS and Parameters ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Constants and Parameters}

A safety factor of 2.5 was selected.
This is in accordance with the recommendations provided by Juvinall and Marshek for average materials operating in ordinary environmental conditions, subjected to loads and stresses that can be determined \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}.
Since the maximum stresses have been simulated, the maximum stresses can be determined with relative accuracy, however due to the uncertainty of vandalism, a smaller safety factor was not selected; thus 2.5 strikes a solid balance between being conservative and still flexible.
A safety factor for tension is specific has been set at 2; as shown in the example below, the initial bolt tension sets the safety factor at $2.3$, so the actual value will be $2.3$ or smaller depending on the applied load.
Bolt properties are also constant and are found in Table \ref{tab:bolts_material}


%------------------------------ ASSUMPTIONS/SIMPLIFICATIONS ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Assumptions and Simplifications}

The following assumptions were made while analysing the bolts at the hips:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Absolutely rigid members \cite{budynas_shigleys_2015}
    \item Ductile bolt material
    \item Negligible impact loading and vibrations
    \item Washers do not greatly influence the found safety factor, and are therefore not included in the analysis
    \item Bolt threaded and unthreaded length can be customized and do not need to follow the formulation provided in Shigley or Juvinall
    \item Fatigue loading is negligible
    \item Load due to tensile moment is evenly distributed between all bolts (which would in reality become larger the further from the pivot point the bolt is)
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------ MATERIAL SELECTION ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Material Selection}

SAE class 9.8 medium carbon bolts were pre-emptively selected as they cover a large swath of diameters (M1.6-M16), have good tensile and proof strength, and are not as expensive as higher class bolts.
Environmental resistance is not paramount as all bolts are contained within the chassis or bellows, however since condensation is likely, some degree of protection against corrosion is necessary.
Coarse-tooth bolts were selected. Although fine tooth bolts have higher tensile area, allowing for smaller diameter bolts, and are less likely to loosen over time, their availability in sizes below M8 seem severely limited \cite{budynas_shigleys_2015} \cite{nord-lock_group_should_2010}.

    \label{fig:bolt_stress}
\end{figure}

The following example illustrates the stress analysis for the fasteners holding the hip plates and motor to the chassis, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:bolt_fbd_hip}.
The clamping members are assumed to be made of Aluminium 6061, with a yield strength of $276MPa$ \cite{matweb_aluminum_nodate}, and a thickness of an eighth inch for each member ($3.175mm$), giving $g = t_1+t_2 = 6.35mm$.
The bolts are made of medium carbon steel (class 9.8), with an elastic modulus of approximately $200MPa$ \cite{azom_aisi_2012}.
The most extreme case for loading on a bolt is the maximum robot size (5kg of litter) with the leg fully extended, when $\theta = 17.18^{\circ}$, $\phi=-51.89^{\circ}$ (from horizontal), $r_1 = 100mm$, $R = 280.17mm$.
$r$ is assumed to be $70.71mm$ and $r_p$ is assumed to be $70mm$.
The initial bolt diameter is estimated to by $5mm$ (M5).
The mechanical properties of class 9.8 steel is found in Table \ref{tab:bolts_material}.
In this case, we can compute the moment arm $P$ and angle of application $\rho$ as

\begin{gather}
    x = r_1 \cos{\theta} + R\cos{\phi} = 268.44 mm
    \\
    y =  0 mm
    \\
    z = r_1 \sin{\theta} + R\sin{\phi} = -190.9012 mm
    \\
    \rho = 0^{\circ}
    \\
    \epsilon = \arctan \big( \frac{z}{x} \big) = -35.41^{\circ}
\end{gather}{}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        P   &= \sqrt{ r_1^2 + R^2 - 2 r_1 R \cos(\phi-\theta-\pi) } \\
            &= \sqrt{ (100mm)^2 + (280.17mm)^2 - 2\cdot 100^{\circ} \cdot 280.17 \cos(-51.89^{\circ} - 17.18^{\circ} - \pi)} \\
            &= 329.40 mm
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

with maximum foot forces given by

\begin{gather}
    F_x = 100N
    \\
    F_y = 100N
    \\
    F_z = 160N
\end{gather}{}

With $F_z$ being the normal force when on flat ground (maximum), $F_x$ being the maximum friction force in the $x$ direction and $F_y$ being the maximum friction force in the $y$ direction, while on a $20^{\circ}$ incline.
Both friction forces will never occur simultaneously, as $100N$ is the total friction amplitude and would thus be split between them, however this gives a conservative estimate.
Equally, the maximum normal and friction forces will never occur simultaneously, however for the sake of being conservative both are considered here simultaneously.

The pure shear reaction forces $V_x$ and $V_y$, tensile reaction force $F_t$ and reaction moment $M$ are.

\begin{gather}
    V_x = F_x = 100N\label{eq:bolt_reaction_shear_x}
    \\
    V_y = F_y = 100N\label{eq:bolt_reaction_shear_y}
    \\
    F_t = F_z = 160N\label{eq:bolt_reaction_shear_z}
    \\
    \begin{split}
        M_y &= (F_z \cos{\epsilon} - F_x \sin{\epsilon})P 
        \\
        &= ((100N)\cos(0^{\circ}) - (100N)\sin(0^{\circ}))(280.17mm) 
        \\
        &=  62041Nmm \label{eq:bolt_reaction_moment_y}
    \end{split}
    \\
    \begin{split}
        M_z &= (F_y \cos{\rho} - F_x \sin{\rho}) P + T 
        \\
        &= ((160N)\cos(-35.41^{\circ}) - (100N)\sin(-35.41^{\circ}))(280.17mm) 
        \\
        &= 32940Nmm \label{eq:bolt_reaction_moment_z}
    \end{split}
\end{gather}

Where $T$ is any pure moment applied along the member (zero in this case).
The centroid is located via symmetry and found to be the center of the bolts.


%------------------------------ STRESS ANALYSIS ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Stress Analysis}

Identified failure modes include pure shear in the bolts, edge shearing of the member, crushing, tensile yielding in the bolts, and tensile yielding of the member (which will be evaluated separately in Section \ref{subsec:hipbracket}).


%------------------------------ PURE SHEAR ------------------------------%
Primary shear stresses $F'_{sh}$ and secondary shear stresses $F''_{sh}$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bolt_stress}.

The primary shear shear stresses are given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_shear_force_1}
    F'_{sh}= \frac{ \sqrt{V_x^2 + V_y^2} }{n} = \frac{\sqrt{(100N)^2 + (100N)^2}}{4{bolts}} = 35.35N
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the number of bolts.
The reaction forces required to counter $M_z$ are given by

\begin{equation}
    M_z = F''_{sh_1} r_1 + F''_{sh_2} r_2 + \dots +  F''_{sh_n} r_n
\end{equation}

Since $r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = r_4$, the secondary shear stress is given by \cite{budynas_shigleys_2015}

\begin{equation}{} \label{eq:bolt_shear_force_2}
    F''_{sh} = \frac{M_z r}{nr^2} = \frac{M_z}{nr} = \frac{32940Nmm}{(4\text{bolts})(70.71mm)} = 116.46N
\end{equation}

Finally, the total shear force per bolt is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_shear_force_total}
    F_{sh} = \sqrt{{F'_{sh}}^{2} + {F''_{sh}}^{2}} = \sqrt{(35.35N)^2 + (116.46N)^2} = 121.70N
\end{equation}

And the shear stress

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_shear_stress}
    \tau = \frac{F_{sh}}{A_b}
\end{equation}{}

where $A_b$ is the cross-section of the bolt along the two clamping members.
The safety factor is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:(SF)_bolt}
    {SF}_{sh} = \frac{S_{sy}}{\tau} = \frac{S_{sy} A_b}{F_{sh}} = \frac{0.58(340MPa)\pi(5mm)^2}{4 (121.70N)} = 67.36
\end{equation}{}

Where $S_{sy}$ is the shear yield strength, given by the Maximum-distortion-energy theory for ductile materials as $S_{sy} = 0.58 S_y$ \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}


%------------------------------ CRUSHING ------------------------------%
The stress for bearing forces varies depending on the individual member thicknesses \cite{ahsan_mcg3131:_2018}.
For members of thickness $t_1 = t_2 = 3.175mm$, the bearing stresses are given by

\begin{gather}
    \sigma = \frac{F_{sh}}{t_1 d} = \frac{121.70\text{N}}{(3.175\text{mm})(5\text{mm})} = 7.66MPa
\end{gather}{}

where $d$ is the nominal major diameter of the thread, $t_i$ is the thickness of member $i$ and $F_{sh}$ is the shear stress held by the bolt.

The safety factors for the bolt and members are given by

\begin{gather}
    (SF)_{cr_b} = \frac{S_{y_b}}{\sigma} = \frac{200\text{MPa}}{7.66\text{MPa}} = 26.08
    \\
    (SF)_{cr_m} = \frac{S_{y_m}}{\sigma} = \frac{276\text{MPa}}{7.66\text{MPa}} = 36.00
\end{gather}{}

With the equation inverted, the minimum required member thickness to match the safety factor is $0.2205\text{mm}$.
This is well below the selected thickness of $3.175\text{mm}$ used.


%------------------------------ EDGE SHEARING ------------------------------%
Edge shearing occurs when the member shears between a bolt and it's edge, usually characterized by a bolt being in too close proximity to the member's edge \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}.The area for edge shearing is given by

\begin{equation}
    A_{es} = \ell_i t
\end{equation}{}

where $\ell$ is the distance from the outside of a bolt to it's edge in the direction of the applied force and $t$ is the thickness of the thinnest member.
For example, the area for edge shearing for an applied force in $x$ would give $A_{es_x} = \ell_x t$.

The shear force is given by $F_i$ from Equation \ref{eq:bolt_shear_force_total}.
The safety factor for edge shearing is given by

\begin{equation}
    (SF)_{es} = \frac{0.577 S_{y_m}}{\tau} = \frac{0.577 S_{y_m}}{\frac{F_{sh}}{A_{es_x}}} = \frac{0.577 S_{y_m} \ell_i t}{F_{sh}}
\end{equation}{}

The required distance from the edge for bolt $i$ is thus given by isolating $\ell_i$ and applying the desired safety factor.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_edge_shearing_distance}
    \ell_i = \frac{(SF)_{es} F_{sh}}{0.577 S_{y_m} t} = \frac{2.5 (121.70\text{N})}{0.577 (276\text{MPa})(3.175\text{mm})} = 0.60mm
\end{equation}{}

Shigley recommends placing the bolts 1.5 times the diameter away from the edge (so $7.5\text{mm}$; the resulting $\ell$ can be increased to match this value, or retained if above this value.


%------------------------------ TENSION ------------------------------%
The initial tension in the bolts is given by \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_initial_tension}
    F_i = k_i A_t S_p = 0.7(14.175mm^2)(650MPa) = 6449.9N
\end{equation}{}

where $k_i$ is a constant between 0.7 and 1.0 (chosen here to be 1.0), $A_t$ is the tensile strength area of the thread given in Table 10.2 of Juvinall and Marshek and curve-fitted with MATLAB's Curve Fitting Tool to $A_t = 0.7023d^2 - 2.669d + 9.963$, and $S_i$ is the proof strength of the material, given in Table 10.5 of Juvinall and Marshek.
The tightening torque is given by

\begin{equation}
    T = 0.2 F_i d = 0.2 (6449.9N) (5mm) = 6449.9N
\end{equation}{}

where $d$ is the nominal major diameter of the thread.

The spring constants of the bolt and member are respectively

\begin{gather}
    A_b = \frac{\pi(5mm)^2}{4} = 19.635mm^2
    \\
    k_b = \frac{A_b E_b}{g} = \frac{(19.635mm^2)(200MPa)}{2(3.175mm)} = 618.42\frac{N}{mm}
    \\
    \begin{split}
        A_m \approx d^2 + 0.68 d g + 0.065 g^2 = (5mm)^2 + 0.68(5mm)(6.35mm) + 0.065(6.35mm)^2 \\
        = 49.21mm^2 \label{eq:bolts_spring_clamping_area}
    \end{split}
    \\
    k_m = \frac{A_m E_m}{g} = \frac{(78.663mm^2)(276MPa)}{2(3.175mm)} = 2138.93\frac{N}{mm}
\end{gather}{}

where $g$ is the effective length, shown in Figure \ref{fig:bolts_spring_constant}, $A_b == A_t$, the nominal major area of the thread, and $E_b$ and $E_m$  are the elastic modulus of the bolt and members respectively.
The clamping area $A_m$ can be approximated for small clearance fits with Equation \ref{eq:bolts_spring_clamping_area} \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{4_Analysis/img/Bolts/BoltTensionDiagram.png}
    \caption{Determining spring constant of bolt and clamping member \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}}
    \label{fig:bolts_spring_constant}
\end{figure}{}

With an external tensile force $F_t$, the bolt tension and clamping force are given by

\begin{equation}{} \label{eq:bolts_tension_force} 
    \begin{split}
        F_b &= F_i + \frac{k_b}{k_b + k_m} \frac{1}{n} \left(F_t + \frac{M_y}{(r_p + r_x)}\right)
        \\
        &= 6449.9N + \frac{618.42\frac{N}{mm}}{618.42\frac{N}{mm} + 2138.93\frac{N}{mm}} \frac{1}{4\text{bolts}} \left( 160N + \frac{62041Nmm}{(70mm) + (50mm)} \right) 
        \\
        &= 6487.81N 
    \end{split}{}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F_m &= F_i - \frac{k_m}{k_b + k_m} \frac{1}{n} \left(F_t + \frac{M_y}{(r_p + r_x)}\right) 
        \\
        &= 6449.9N - \frac{618.42\frac{N}{mm}}{618.42\frac{N}{mm} + 2138.93\frac{N}{mm}} \frac{1}{4\text{bolts}} \left( 160N + \frac{62041Nmm}{(70mm) + (50mm)} \right)
        \\
        &= 6318.55N
    \end{split}{}
\end{equation}{}

where $F_t$ is the applied external force, $k_b$ is the spring constant of the bolt,  $k_m$ is the spring constant of the clamping members,  $\frac{M_y}{(r_p + r_x)}$ is the tension required to resist the moment $M_y$ around the pivot point $r_p$ (for the bolt the furthest from the pivot, and thus experiencing the highest stress), and $n$ is the number of bolts.
The applied force has little impact on the force felt by the member or bolt; the initial tension is still much larger.
The safety factor in tension for the bolt is

\begin{gather}
    \sigma_b = \frac{n F_b}{A_t} = \frac{4(6487.81N)}{\pi(5mm)^2} = 330.42MPa
    \\
    {SF}_t = \frac{S_{y_b}}{\sigma} = \frac{720MPa}{329.616MPa} = 2.17
\end{gather}{}

It was found that the safety factor sits around 2.2 regardless of the external load; this is likely because the initial tension of the bolt is significantly larger than the external forces, and thus they have little impact on the safety factor.
A factor as low as two is allowed for tension.
For cases where the bolts do not all have the same distance $r_p+r_x$, then only the number of bolts at distance $r_p+r_x$ should be considered.


%------------------------------ CRITICAL REVIEW ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Critical Review}

Bolts that are likely to fail are found in two places; the bolts holding the hip motors and brackets to the chassis, and the bolts connecting the lower leg (tibia) to the pulley at the knee.
The former was analyzed above.
The safety factors for the fasteners at the hips are acceptable for all modes of failure for $d=4\text{mm}$.
The safety factor in tension is unlikely to dip under $2$.
Even with the normal force $F_z$ increased by a factor of 100, the safety factor in tension is above $1.5$; the majority of the loading in the bolts is still from the initial tightening, and thus the required safety factor has been lowered to $2$.
The safety factor in shear is more volatile, however, and given large loads or very small bolt diameters and $r$, it can pass below $2.5$.
Since the shear safety factor depends on the distance between the bolts and their centroid $r$ and the bolt diameter $d$, but $r$ and $n$ are set by the part geometry independently of the fastener analysis, the bolt size is the only parameter influencing the shear safety factor.
Crushing depends on the bolt diameter and thickness and edge shearing depends on thickness and distance $\ell$.
There are thus three parameters that can be modified to minimize the safety factors.

Some geometry was ignored.
For example, when calculating the forces in tension, the load was evenly divided between the bolts. This is not correct, as the bolts furthest from the pivot point would take more force than those closer.
Since the safety factor in tension does not vary until increasing the applied load by a couple orders of magnitude, this simplification is acceptable.
For the given example, the height between the center of the hip bracket and the bolts shown in Figure \ref{fig:bolt_fbd_hip} was forgotten.
This would have reduced the moment impacting the tensile force, and so does not negatively impact the safety factor of the analysis.
Finally, The bolts were not analyzed for fatigue either.
Juvinall and Marshek note that fatigue occurs only with repeated plastic yielding \cite{juvinall_fundamentals_2012}.
Since the bolts stay under their yield strength at all times, fatigue should not be a concern.


%------------------------------ PARAMETRIZATION ------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Parameterization}

The distance $P$ from the applied forces to the centroid, distance from the bolt to centroid $r$, and angles $\rho$ and $\epsilon$ between $P$ and $x$ around $z$ and $y$ respectively will be given as inputs for parametrization.
The values of $d$, $t_m$ and $\ell$ are determined by first generating a range of values for all three, then creating 3D matrices with the following 2D principle extended to 3D:

\begin{gather}
    \text{Matrix}_r = 
    \begin{bmatrix}{}
        r_1 & r_1 & \dots & r_1 \\
        r_2 & r_2 & \dots & r_2 \\
        \dots  &  &       & \dots \\
        r_n & r_n & \dots & r_n
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    \text{Matrix}_d = 
    \begin{bmatrix}{}
        d_1 & d_2 & \dots & d_n \\
        d_1 & d_2 & \dots & d_n \\
        \dots & & & \dots \\
        d_1 & d_2 & \dots & d_n \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}{}

The stress analysis functions are then applied to each combination of $d$, $t_m$ and $\ell$ and the one that minimizes some measure of space occupied (such as minimizing the area occupied by the bolts) while maintaining the desired safety factors of $2$ for tension and $2.5$ for everything else will be selected.
