	abstract = {In order to acclimatize amphibious bio-crab robot to the amphibious environment better, a series-parallel structure of amphibious bio-crab robot is proposed, then we designed an amphibious bio-crab robot which use the modular worm and worm wheel transmission mechanism to achieve the transmission of the leg joint. A single leg and overall walking simulation model of amphibious bio-crab robot was established, and then carried out a kinematics and dynamics simulation. Finally, through the experiment we got the kinematics parameters and characteristics of amphibious bio-crab robot, which verify the correctness of its structure design, dual four-legged gait planning feasibility and the necessary of a buffer module for physical prototype. The research also provided a viable technical solution to the physical prototype development.},

	abstract = {Moment of inertia, denoted by I, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass. Mass moments of inertia have units of dimension ML2([mass] × [length]2). It should not be confused with the second moment of area, which is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.
For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact closed-form expression. Typically this occurs when the mass density is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the parallel axis and perpendicular axis theorems.
This article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the center of mass unless otherwise specified.},
