\subsection{Standards, codes and rules}

Based on the research completed and the number of results found regarding standards, codes and regulations; laws, regulations and standards applicable to autonomous robots, due to their relatively recent introduction to the market, have yet to be published. Some of the existing standards can still be used as a baseline for the design of new autonomous robotic systems.

Table \ref{table:standards} found in the appendices contains ISO, ASTM, RIA and IEC standards and regulations for manufacturing equipment, service robots and heavy machinery,  which could apply to the design, manufacturing, and use of autonomous robots in public environments. These standards and regulations include test methods to determine the mobility of the robot, design criteria for public and worker's safety, and regulations regarding the manufacturing, use and consumption of products in Canada. As stated by ISO: "It [the standard] does not apply to non-industrial robots, although the safety principles presented can be useful to other areas of robotics" \cite{iso_iso/ts_nodate}.
