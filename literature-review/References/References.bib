	abstract = {Product miniaturization is a key aspect of manufacturing nowadays. Computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools are the major tools used in manufacturing industries for producing miniaturized products. However, CNC machines are still big, bulky and stationary. This research is an effort to develop a modular machine on a robotic platform which would be able to carry out machining operation. Hexapod robots are mobile, small and stable robots which are developed having a lot of variety. In this project a Hexapod robot was designed and fabricated for machining operation. The research scope for this project was limited to 1-D machining i.e. drilling operation. A suitable existing robot (hexapod) design was followed in this project. A drilling spindle was attached with the robot to carry out the machining operation. The robot was controlled using serial communication. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) was developed to control the Hexapod which had all the required algorithm inside. Machining operations were carried out with the prototype robot to test its performance. The highest accuracy was found using spindle speed of 2500RPM and velocity of 200mm/min. The repeatability found using these parameters were around 25micron. The positional accuracy of the robot movement was compared with that of an existing commercial micromachining system. The performance of the robot was found to be almost similar to that of the commercial machine.},

	abstract = {Desire for better prosthetic feet for below-knee amputees has motivated the development of several active and highly functional devices. These devices are equipped with controlled actuators in order to replicate biomechanical characteristics of the human ankle, improve the amputee gait, and reduce the amount of metabolic energy consumed during locomotion. However, the functioning of such devices on human subjects is difficult to test due to changing gait, unknown ankle dynamics, complicated interaction between the foot and the ground, as well as between the residual limb and the prosthesis. Commonly used approaches in control of prosthetic feet treat these effects as disturbances and ignore them, thereby degrading the performance and efficiency of the devices. In this paper, an artificial neural network-based hierarchical controller is proposed that first recognizes the amputees' intent from the actual measured gait data, then selects a displacement profile for the prosthetic joint based on the amputees' intent, and then adaptively compensates for the unmodeled dynamics and disturbances for closed loop stability with guaranteed tracking performance. Detailed theoretical analysis is carried out to establish the stability and robustness of the proposed approach. The performance of the controller presented in this paper is demonstrated using actual gait data collected from human subjects. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategy over conventional approaches to the control of the prosthetic ankle, especially when the presence of noise, uncertainty in terrain interaction, disturbance torques, variations in gait parameters, and changes in gait are considered.},

	abstract = {The analysis of inter-leg coordination in insect walking is generally a study of six-legged locomotion. For decades, the stick insect Carausius morosus has been instrumental for unravelling the rules and mechanisms that control leg coordination in hexapeds. We analysed inter-leg coordination in C. morosus that freely walked on straight paths on plane surfaces with different slopes. Consecutive 1.7 s sections were assigned inter-leg coordination patterns (which we call gaits) based on footfall patterns. Regular gaits, i.e. wave, tetrapod or tripod gaits, occurred in different proportions depending on surface slopes. Tetrapod gaits were observed most frequently, wave gaits only occurred on 90 deg inclining slopes and tripod gaits occurred most often on 15 deg declining slopes, i.e. in 40\% of the sections. Depending on the slope, 36–66\% of the sections were assigned irregular gaits. Irregular gaits were mostly due to multiple stepping by the front legs, which is perhaps probing behaviour, not phase coupled to the middle legs’ cycles. In irregular gaits, middle leg and hindleg coordination was regular, related to quadrupedal walk and wave gaits. Apparently, front legs uncouple from and couple to the walking system without compromising middle leg and hindleg coordination. In front leg amputees, the remaining legs were strictly coordinated. In hindleg and middle leg amputees, the front legs continued multiple stepping. The coordination of middle leg amputees was maladapted, with front legs and hindlegs performing multiple steps or ipsilateral legs being in simultaneous swing. Thus, afferent information from middle legs might be necessary for a regular hindleg stepping pattern.},

Turcon® Varilip® PDR from Trelleborg Sealing Solutions is the optimum solution for high-speed rotating applications. The rotary shaft seals are constructed from one or multiple Turcon® PTFE based sealing elements which are mechanically retained in a precision machined metal body. The metal body gives a robust static seal against the housing, preventing thermal cycling, while the Turcon® sealing element provides positive dynamic sealing on the shaft, leading to excellent performance at high rotary speeds. Characterized by low friction and stick-slip-free running, the seal reduces temperature generation, permits higher peripheral speeds and lowers power consumption. This results in a long service life, with maximized mean time between planned maintenance and greater productivity.  
 The exceptional low-friction characteristics of Turcon® Varilip® PDR reduce torque. This in turn cuts power consumption, which can contribute to lower equipment running costs and ultimately decreased energy bills.},

First, the dimensions, joint structure, range of motion, and mass distribution of the robot are determined by considering biological data of the crabs, lobsters, and insects. Second, the joint actuators including motors and reduction gears are chosen through the simple force analysis. Third, the two types of the joint mechanism are established for the detailed design. Finally, the 2D design is performed using AutoCAD which is a commercial CAD software. The detailed design features are addressed in this paper.},

The purpose of this project is to perform Resistance spot welding process between mild steel 1010 and stainless steel 304 by changing variable parameters also to determine the modal properties of the specimens that are mode shape and natural frequency using finite element analysis (FEA) by MSC Nastran/Patran and experimental modal analysis (EMA) by using
impact hammer. There is a total of 6 sets of specimens has been investigated for similar welding parameters which are welding current, weld time, electrodes force and hold time. At the end of the study, both results from numerical and modal analysis will be compared. In this project, it shows that the discrepancies of natural frequency between finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental modal analysis (EMA) are below than 11 \%. Set D with welding parameter of welding current 4A, with 5s time duration and 35 psi pressure supplied has been chosen to have the lowest percentage of errors compared to all other set of experiments. As a conclusion, finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental modal analysis (EMA) are the most reliable method to extract modal properties.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the development of arm and leg of seabed walking robot named CRABSTER200 (CR200) for precise seabed exploration and underwater works in coastal area with strong tidal current. For seabed walking and precise underwater works, CR200 uses six legs and front two legs can be transformed to manipulators. In order to design robotic arm and leg, the parameters such as the degree of freedom (D.O.F), dimensions, motion range, joint structure, and mass are determined. Then, suitable joint actuators and reduction gears are selected through a simple force analysis. In addition, a communication method between legs and main controller, actuator controllers, and sensors are selected. The detailed mechanical design for 200m class pressure–resistance as well as watertight is performed. Also, the arms and legs are built by assembled fabricating the mechanical parts. Finally, in order to verify the performance of the arm and leg, the watertight test with 25bar pressure–resistance and joints operating test through posture control of CR200 are performed. This paper describes the whole design and implementation process of the underwater robotic arm and leg of the seabed robot CR200. Highlights • We develop underwater arm and leg of seabed walking robot CRABSTER200. • CRABSTER200 uses six legs during walking and front two legs as manipulators during underwater work. • We design link and joint system with 200m class pressure–resistance and watertight. • Developed arm and leg have the sufficient performance for underwater work and seabed walking.},

The proposed system replaces fluidic connectors found in conventional water cooling systems with a thermal contact heat exchanger. This approach enhances reliability by eliminating leakage risks; however, it also undermines thermal performance by adding thermally resistive heat transfer interfaces to the overall system. An experimental setup was constructed in order to simulate heat generation by a single processor and cooling by means of three thermal contact heat exchanger plate designs; straight channels, a serpentine channel, and mixed straight-serpentine channels. Investigation of the impacts of flowrates and heat loads upon pressure losses, pump loads, and system temperatures demonstrated that the straight channel plate design would be most practical for industry implementation as it required the lowest pump loads while delivering a thermal performance that was comparable to those of the remaining two designs.},

Bijugopeda is a nomen dubium based on an undiagnostic and incom-plete(?) camel footprint. A wide range of extramorphological variation in camel footprints is documented, and justifies this extensive synonymy. Non-camel ruminant footprints belong to the ichnogenus Pecoripeda sensu lato and can be distinguished from Lamaichnum by having relatively long and narrow, anteriorly-converging digit imprints that are completely separated by an interdigital sulcus. The fossil record of camel footprints suggests homeomorphy in camel foot structure throughout much of the Neogene and thus that the distinctive elastic pad (cushion) of the camel foot and the characteristic semidigitigrade stance had evolved by middle Miocene time.},

	abstract = {This paper depicts the structural design of a novel water-jet-based spherical underwater robot. The propulsion system is made up of four water-jet thrusters and 8 steering servo motors which can adjust the polydirectional shift of thrusters nozzle to achieve 4-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) motion. Every two thrusters nozzles formed an angle of 90°in one plane. A bilayer structure was adopted for the control system to obtain data from various sensors, meanwhile control the outputs of ports after calculation processing. The primary side whose core is TMS320f28335 processor was employed for the data collection and disposing calculation. And made the Atmega2560 processor as the main chip of the subordinate side to control the propulsion system. The Micron Data Modem is integrated into the electrical design, which can realize the data transmission and communication between multi-SURs in future. Based on the theoretical analysis and calculation, a series of underwater experiments were carried out to test the performance of the novel spherical underwater robot; these experiments included surge–sway motion test, yaw motion test, heave motion test, and anti-interference test. A FSMC controller was employed to control the direction of the vectored water-jet thrusters for underwater motion. The experimental results demonstrated that the novel spherical underwater robot could realize underwater motion rapidly and accurately. The performance of the novel SUR is more nimbler and flexible than the previous SUR-II we developed.},

	abstract = {In the United States, stroke is the number one cause of severe long-term disability and of the 15 million people that experience a stroke each year worldwide, 5 million will be left with a disability (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke).
These may include paralysis or movement problems, sensory disturbances, and language problems (National Stroke Association). Exoskeletons are a form of wearable technology that aims to enhance or aid human motion. They are a valuable tool in assisting in muscle training and regaining independence after a stroke. Exoskeletons encourage neuroplasticity, a reorganization of neural connections in the brain throughout an individual’s life, by providing patients with sensory input and learning through repetitive and intensive movements while reducing the labor required by caretakers. These devices are portable and can be used in day-to-day life, outside of a clinical setting.},
